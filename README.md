# More layoffs in the tech industry

# My Opinion

Snap Inc. announced it would lay off about 528 employees, or 10% of its workforce, signaling that the tech industry's layoff trend from 2023 might continue amid economic challenges. The layoffs aim to improve financial efficiency and investor relations, following a share price drop of 4%. Snap expects to incur pre-tax charges of $55 million to $75 million from the layoffs, primarily for severance costs. So far, the tech industry has seen extensive job reductions, continuing a trend of high layoff numbers from the previous year. I believe this trend won't stop for the foreseeable future as many companies are finding it more costly to keep employees. And it'll hit new grads much more as companies wont find the need for as many associate developers, for example, as before due to high costs in retention, training, onboarding, etc.

It's really unfortunate that there are massive tech layoffs occuring and paints a grim outlook for 
the future. It's interesting that this seems to be a trend instead of just a handful of companies 
laying off employees. It makes me wonder what the reason(s) are for such massive layoffs? What is 
happening in tech to cause such a hemorrhaging? The article states that the companies are laying 
off to cut costs to improve the company's financials, suggesting that the tech companies are not 
as profitable as they would like to be. This is probably due to some of the technology being not 
as relevant and thus not as profitable. I wonder if this will be trend for tech workers in that 
they will be able to get tech jobs because technology is here to stay but they might end up 
becoming "working vagrants": working at a job until the tech becomes less relevant leading them to 
be laid off to hop on the next up and coming tech only for that tech to eventually become less
relevant and the cycle continues. It seems that tech jobs are in fluctuating demand entirely dependent on the specific technology itself
